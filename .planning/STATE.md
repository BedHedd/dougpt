# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-02-26)

**Core value:** Create high-quality, locally generated DougDoug-speaker to Twitch-chat response pairs that are accurate enough to fine-tune a local language model.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Deterministic Video Ingestion

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Deterministic Video Ingestion)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-26 - Initial roadmap created and requirement traceability mapped.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in `PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1-4 structure follows dependency chain: ingestion -> transcript extraction -> alignment/curation -> training/ops.
- v1 scope excludes realtime/live workflows and paid external services.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Alignment confidence thresholds and lag calibration will need empirical tuning during Phase 3.
- Local hardware envelope for fine-tuning presets may constrain Phase 4 throughput.
