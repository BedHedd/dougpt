# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-13)

**Core value:** Every experiment/feature branch is self-documenting from creation — branching, worktree setup, README population, and project naming happen automatically so you can start building immediately.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Template Preparation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Template Preparation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3 phases derived — Template Prep, Branch Creation Flow, Root README Index. Research suggested a 4th phase (Lifecycle Management) but no v1 requirements map to it — deferred to v2.
- [Roadmap]: Branch Creation (WKTR) and File Population (FILE) combined into single Phase 2 because they are one atomic workflow — creating a branch without populating files is incomplete.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 (Root README Index) requires cross-branch editing (feature branch → master). Strategy needs validation during Phase 3 planning. Research ARCHITECTURE.md has Option A/B/C proposals.
