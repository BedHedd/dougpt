# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-13)

**Core value:** Every experiment/feature branch is self-documenting from creation — branching, worktree setup, README population, and project naming happen automatically so you can start building immediately.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Branch Creation Flow

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Template Preparation) — COMPLETE
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase
Status: Phase complete, ready for Phase 2 planning
Last activity: 2026-02-13 — Completed 01-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 33%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 1 min
- Total execution time: 0.02 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Template Preparation | 1/1 | 1 min | 1 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (1 min)
- Trend: -

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3 phases derived — Template Prep, Branch Creation Flow, Root README Index. Research suggested a 4th phase (Lifecycle Management) but no v1 requirements map to it — deferred to v2.
- [Roadmap]: Branch Creation (WKTR) and File Population (FILE) combined into single Phase 2 because they are one atomic workflow — creating a branch without populating files is incomplete.
- [01-01]: Bare $variable syntax chosen over ${variable} for cleaner markdown and no shell confusion
- [01-01]: Sentinel comment placed on first line for trivial detection and clean removal

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 (Root README Index) requires cross-branch editing (feature branch → master). Strategy needs validation during Phase 3 planning. Research ARCHITECTURE.md has Option A/B/C proposals.
