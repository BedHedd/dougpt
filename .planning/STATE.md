## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in `PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1-4 structure follows dependency chain: ingestion -> transcript extraction -> alignment/curation -> training/ops.
- v1 scope excludes realtime/live workflows and paid external services.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Alignment confidence thresholds and lag calibration will need empirical tuning during Phase 3.
- Local hardware envelope for fine-tuning presets may constrain Phase 4 throughput.
