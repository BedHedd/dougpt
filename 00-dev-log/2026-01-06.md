## loading a frame from a video
Originally I was going to run open cv, but I ran into build issues and the library's version of ffmpeg did not support av1 videos. so I used a subprocess and ffmpeg to extract a frame out.

## investigating vlms
I tried loading unsloth's qwen3-vl models into `llama.cpp`, but I kept running out of vram, so I tried the qwen version from the lm studio search. I had chatgpt give me code for making an openai api request for a image. The model did a better job than I expected.

For the first prompt of 
> Describe what you see. If there is text, transcribe it.

This image is a screenshot from a live stream, showing a person streaming while a map of Europe is displayed on a large screen behind them. Here is a breakdown of what is visible: **1\. The Streamer (Bottom Left):**

-   A man with brown hair and a beard is seated at a desk.
-   He is wearing headphones and speaking into a large, professional microphone.
-   On his desk, there are several books stacked on top of each other and a small, orange, cartoonish figurine with large eyes.

**2\. The Map (Center/Right):**

-   A large, white-and-blue political map of Europe is displayed.
-   The map clearly labels the names of many European countries, including:
    -   **Northern Europe:** Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania.
    -   **Western Europe:** Ireland, Britain, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Germany.
    -   **Central Europe:** Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Poland.
    -   **Southeast Europe:** Italy, Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Ukraine, Moldova.
-   The map shows the countries in white, with the landmasses of the North Sea, Baltic Sea, and Mediterranean Sea colored in light blue.

**3\. Text Elements:**

-   **Chat Log (Left Side):** A vertical chat window is visible, showing a conversation between viewers. The text includes phrases like:
    -   "believe in the doubt"
    -   "So when Doug won't open the oxygen gates, we have to rely on the fart barons"
    -   "Because RIGGED"
    -   "I have 80 cakes on the table"
    -   "the strat was to wait until doug goes live or doesn't because the prediction goes past the time"
-   **On-Screen Text (Bottom Right):** A banner reads:
    -   `PARKZER Q&A`
    -   `Stop donating so I can leave`

The overall scene suggests the streamer is hosting a Q&A session or discussion, possibly related to a game or prediction event, as hinted at by the chat messages and the "Q&A" banner.

I then refined the prompt
> Get all the chat messages. Please also include usernames with messages

The output was:

It doesn't seem to be able to get the emotes, so we'll have to figure that out later.
