## Overall Progress
- [ ] creating an app interface to inspect transcripts + chat
- [x] side quest: replicating markdown paste images 

## app interface to inspect transcripts + chat
I was going to work on this, but realized that I couldn't paste screenshot to illustrate what how I want the tool to look. I could have used the marimo notebooks from before [chat-extraction.py](https://github.com/BedHedd/dougpt/blob/chat-extraction/chat-extraction.py), but it didn't work for all video codecs and was more effort to customize.

## replicating markdown paste images
I had chatgpt replicate my setup from markdown paste for the path I screenshotted this setting and passed my markdown paste settings. 

![vscode settings](../00-supporting-files/images/2026-03-01/20260301195611.png)

```
${workspaceRoot}/00-supporting-files/images/${fileBasenameNoExtension} 
```

and the file name structure
```
${datetime|yyyyMMDDHHmmss}
```

ultimately what worked was 
```json
"markdown.copyFiles.destination": {
  "**/*.md": "${documentWorkspaceFolder}/00-supporting-files/images/${documentBaseName}/${isoTime/^([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9])-([0-9][0-9])-([0-9][0-9])T([0-9][0-9]):([0-9][0-9]):([0-9][0-9]).*$/$1$2$3$4$5$6/}.${fileExtName}"
}
```
This works, but I still can't copy and paste rich text D:

### other ones I tried
#### unixtime
it works with the vscode default settings, but doesn't quite match up with the existing file structure I use elsewhere
```json
"markdown.copyFiles.destination": {
  "**/*.md": "${documentWorkspaceFolder}/00-supporting-files/images/${documentBaseName}/${unixTime}.${fileExtName}
"
}
```

#### daily notes parsing
This works for daily note, but wouldn't work if I wanted to paste this into other markdown files
```json
"markdown.copyFiles.destination": {
  "**/[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9].md": "${documentWorkspaceFolder}/00-supporting-files/images/${documentBaseName}/${isoTime/^([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9])-([0-9][0-9])-([0-9][0-9])T([0-9][0-9]):([0-9][0-9]):([0-9][0-9]).*$/$1$2$3$4$5$6/}.${fileExtName}"
}
```
Though the core logic worked well enough that I just swapped out the keys between unix time and this one.
