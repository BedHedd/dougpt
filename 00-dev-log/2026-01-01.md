## overall progress
- [ ] came up with the idea
- [ ] took notes into the first ai invasion video


## making my own ai based on DougDoug's twitch chat
Now I want to make process the first ai invasion video to make a dataset for how dougdoug's chat would react/plan so that we can finetune a model to behave like doug's twitch chat.

Looks like someone made a playlist of the edited versions
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzY2D6XUB8KfzQbQBRV2KVxrRJ3kO1Bwo&si=q7ZVlvatYP4VmZVT

The first full stream is

Need some python code to grab messages from chat based on the transcript. 

In the meantime, I'll rewatch the stream and make some notes. Let's just start by processing a single segment and see if we can extract chat and doug from transcript
